# MI-training
Motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are a categry of BCIs in which a user self-generates the motor imagery (MI) signal by imagining the movement of different body parts such a hand, a foot or the tongue. The ability of different users is different in generating the MI signals that are classifiable by a computer. This code provides a form of neurofeedback trainin to help users better control their MI signal.
